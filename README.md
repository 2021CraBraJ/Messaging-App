# Messaging-App
This application will allow users to work and communicate more efficiently. To achieve this we will incorporate the best features of the major apps while making it non-intrusive.
For example in other apps you will hear a sound and get a notification every time you receive a message. But the problem with that is that it takes your focus away from what you're working on.
To solve this we will incorporate message holding(Do Not Disturb) which will allow the user to set an amount of time that they won't receive messages for. But if the user is allowing the sender to set high priority then the user will still receive the message. Our user interface will use colors that are easy for the eyes to see making more comfortable for the user to look at. For teams of people we will incorporate groups that require an invite to join. There will be two types of groups a Leader group or a Joined group. This allows there to be groups that have a leader and there to be groups that all have control over the group. Overall this app will be designed for teams and users to cooperate more simply and productively.
